# StudyPlan

Application in progress.

An application thanks to which the student, having the number of hours, is able to prepare the schedule himself. 
The only condition is that the number of hours planned for a given semester corresponds to the sum of the hours of the individual lecture courses.
Ultimately, the application will be developed so that, on the basis of the lecturers' running plan, the stuent will receive a ready schedule of classes with an hourly schedule 
and information where the classes will take place (for example: room number or in the case of PE classes - weather forecast based on which the place will be determined classes - stadium or hall).
